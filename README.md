Title: "On the usage of machine-learning techniques to speed-up amplitude evaluation in high-energy physics"

Abstract: 
We investigate the usage of machine-learning techniques to improve the computation speed of numerical amplitudes for scattering processes at colliders. Specifically, we train a neural network to learn the features of a given scattering amplitude. We assess the performance in terms of CPU-time and of the numerical accuracy, exploring the cases when the phase-space is partitioned and/or enhanced with suitable functions.

The file named "tesi.pdf" is the thesis. 

Part of the code I used was taken from https://github.com/JosephPB/n3jet.
